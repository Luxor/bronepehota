# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: Faction selection <30s, army building <5min, mobile-optimized interactions
**Constraints**: Mobile-first (44x44px tap targets, 48x48px for action buttons), Russian UI only, localStorage-based persistence, offline-capable during session, loading states <200ms, breakpoints at 768px and 1024px  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [x] **Russian UI**: All user-facing text, error messages, tooltips in Russian? ✓ (FR-020, FR-028 added)
- [x] **File-Based Storage**: Game data in `src/data/` JSON files? API routes use sync file ops? ✓ (Existing architecture)
- [x] **Client-Side State**: Army state in `localStorage` with key `bronepehota_army`? ✓ (FR-017, existing pattern)
- [x] **Type Safety**: Types in `src/lib/types.ts`? No `any` without justification? ✓ (Will extend existing types)
- [x] **Game Logic Tests**: Tests in `src/__tests__/` for mechanics in `game-logic.ts`? ✓ (No new dice mechanics, existing tests apply)
- [x] **Dice Notation**: Correct formats (D6, D12+2, 2D12, ББ)? ✓ (No new dice logic)
- [x] **Faction System**: FactionID type updated? JSON data files updated? ✓ (Uses existing 3 factions)
- [x] **Reference Docs**: Game mechanics verified against `doc/panov/` materials? ✓ (Unit costs from existing data)
- [x] **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly? Responsive layout? 44x44px min tap targets? ✓ (FR-019, FR-025 added breakpoints)
- [x] **Mobile Testing**: Core flows tested on mobile/emulation? ✓ (SC-007, SC-008 now with specific validation methods)
- [x] **Soldier Images**: Visible and identifiable on mobile for unit selection? ✓ (FR-018, SC-008 with validation method)
- [x] **Accessibility**: ARIA labels? Keyboard navigation? Focus management? ✓ (FR-022, FR-024 added, FR-023 added)
- [x] **Performance**: Loading states within 200ms? ✓ (FR-021, SC-012 added)
- [x] **User Testing**: Measurable validation method specified? ✓ (SC-003, SC-008 now with participant count)

**Result**: All constitution requirements satisfied. New accessibility and mobile UX requirements added. No violations to justify.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
